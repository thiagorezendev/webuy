## 📖 About

WeBuy is a web-based e-commerce platform designed to simplify grocery shopping, especially for people who may not have the ability or time to visit physical stores. Developed as a project for the *Programming II* and *Database II* courses.

WeBuy was inspired by the social context of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which online shopping became essential. While many of these services have declined, their usefulness, especially for the elderly, remains evident.

This project highlights the use of Laravel's powerful features and demonstrates growth in database handling, front-end/back-end integration, and clean application architecture.
